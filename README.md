# Useful Tools for Writing React

Below are some helpful resources that may accelerate your React learning:

1. Install the [React Devtools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en). This gives you access to some pretty great tools that make it a lot easier to debug your programs in React. Here is the [repo](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools#faq) for the extension.

2. Most importantly, the official [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/), courtesy of Facebook. While you won't have the time to read over all of it now, it might be good to have bookmarked while you learn React.

3. In addition to the React docs, the documentation for [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is a great resource as well. Many of the labs in this phase were created using Create React App, and your projects will be too. Use this to learn more about the files structure and common tools you'll see used hand-in-hand with React.
